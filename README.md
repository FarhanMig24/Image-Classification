# Image-Classification
Basic and Intermediatery CNN Models I learnt to run on multiple class based image datasets.

Through out the process of learning Deep Learning, I came across various prexisitng datasets
on multiple class based image datasets and various models which already exist and can run on
this models to predict the outcome of a given picture to the model.

Every model has special specialities, initial modesl require more resources to run and thus newer
and more lightweight and optimised models are developed on day to day basis in order to get best
results in limited time and resources constraint.
